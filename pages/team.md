      Ondřej founded Oplatai in March 2018 to fill the gap of missing speech and conversation solutions for companies on the market.
      He realized there is a huge difference between the speech interfaces promoted by big companies like Google, Amazon and Apple
      and the speech interfaces which are available for e-commerce or public institutions.
