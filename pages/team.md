... we not only deliver state-of-the art service, but we also enjoy pushing it further. Yes, we have a research background.

## [CEO, Ondřej Plátek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ondrejplatek/)
Ondřej founded Oplatai in March 2018 to fill the gap of missing speech and conversation solutions for companies on the market.
He realized there is a huge difference between the speech interfaces promoted by big companies like Google, Amazon and Apple
and the speech interfaces which are available for e-commerce or public institutions.

He visited labs
- IBM Watson, Prague, CZ
- Apple, Cupertino, California (twice)
- Ufal MFF CUNI, Prague, CZ

and helped startups to build their speech interfaces
