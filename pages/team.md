Ondřej founded Oplatai in March 2018 to fill the gap of missing speech and conversation solutions for companies on the market.
He realized there is a huge difference between the speech interfaces promoted by big companies like Google, Amazon and Apple
and the speech interfaces which are available for e-commerce or public institutions.

Ondřej has gained experience with speech technology mostly as a researcher and a consultant.
He visited labs:
- Siri Speech team at Apple, Cupertino, California
- Siri Language Modelling team at Apple, Cupertino, California
- Ufal MFF CUNI, Prague, CZ
- IBM Watson, Prague, CZ
- FBK, Trento, Italy

He has helped startups to build their speech interfaces:

- [Omilia](http://omilia.com)
- [Angee](http://meetangee.com)
